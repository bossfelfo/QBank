# QBank
Qbank is a Fictional &amp; Minimalist Bank that simulates a real bank, Developed using Javascript, HTML and CSS. In this project I've learned and applied advanced techniques of DOM manipulation and animation, I also received the challenge of making the site fully responsive

## Project
The project was all about putting advance DOM Manipulation into practise and the use of local storage

P.S: The website isn't responsive
